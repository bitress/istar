    <b>Abstract:</b>  
    Previous studies highlighted the impacts of technology-mediated environments to language learning and teaching. The Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna, after having developed  technology-based software to build confidence and improve communication skills of the students, carried out the Phase II of its English Development Program project to test its validity. This quasi-experimental research was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of EngWow as an alternative online learning resource in empowering the communicative competence of language learners in an EFL classroom. Within a period of three months, data were collected from an intact class of 41 students specializing in Engineering-related courses. The participants were subjected to undergo 10 lessons from the EngWow. Through teacher-made Communicative Competence Test, a pretest and a posttest were administered, and a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire was utilized to validate the quantitative data. Mean and t-test were employed in the treatment of data. Results yielded significant improvement in the communicative competence of the students after having exposed to EngWow. Qualitatively, findings revealed that students favor Eng Wow due to flexibility of time, accessibility to technology and internet, self-paced learning and researching, face to face interaction, and comfortable environment. Thus, EngWow connives with foregoing researches that technological development is very significant and effective in learning a foreign language.

  <b>Abstract:</b>  
  Amongst the pop-cultural genres, the concept of mash-up, dealing with the amalgamation of certain mainstream works of art and lowbrow literature has become the vogue of twenty-first century literature. The heterocosmic theory propounded by Brian McHale in postmodernist fiction and the concept of chrono-synclastic infundibulum are used to create an alternate universe theory and in the fabrication  of multiple universes(multiverses).  Detective fiction that operates on the ground of logic and skepticism is inverted in postmodern mystery; and science fiction, a genre that locates itself in the liminal space between fiction and reality are perfectly brought together by numerous Japanese writers in the construction of the mash up narrative.  The paper would focus on the mash-up between detective and science fiction that has been created by Japanese writers Haruki Murakami, Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto among others. The researcher would concentrate on various tenets that define the mash-up and provide a transrealistic reading of the selected novels.

    <b>Abstract:</b>  
    Suicide which is often interpreted as a sign of weakness and frailty has become synonymous with the characterisation of women. Jocasta, is given the honour of being the first character   to commit suicide in literature; unfortunately she also happens to be a woman. There are numerous literary examples of women committing self - immolation as an inevitable measure which leads to the idea that the writers have symbolised them as pathetic figures, irrespective of time and age. There was Ophelia in Hamlet, followed by Anna Karenina, Emma Bovary in Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, Edna Pontellier in The Awakening and Eustacia in The Return of the Native who committed mélange, among many other. The act of Felo de Se, which raises the question was the person who committed the felon really responsible for it? Especially in these cases, which involve a woman? Is committing suicide a representation of inescapability? What if there is a reversal of role in terms of victim, despite the act of suicide? Is it committed really as Queen Gertrude states, “Incapable of her own distress”? What if the act itself transgresses from being self-immolation to an act of vengeance and revenge.  This paper could focus on various literary suicides committed by women characters till the  twentieth  century and the reversal of role from the contemporary times pertaining primarily to the novels, The Drivers Seat by Muriel Spark, Death in a Delphi Seminar by Norman N. Holland and The Blind Assassin by 
    Margaret Atwood.

    <b>Abstract:</b>  
    In her first published novel, Jane Eyre (1847) Charlotte Brontë portrays Jane, the protagonist, as a struggling spirit who is plain and simple in appearance but intellectual and courageous in nature. Examining the narrative structure of the novel, one can see that each household in which Jane finds herself is under the regulation of a dominant male master, who is surrounded by a group of dependant women. Each of the male character tries to chain her in a bond of slavery. While one wants to enslave her in passion, the other wants to imprison her in principle. This paper is an attempt to show that the male characters in the novel function as the catalysts for discovering Jane’s selfhood, her self-potentiality, and achieving her liberty. The opposing forces, unconsciously, work as the driving force for attaining Jane the status of the hero in the novel. The novel is a journey from darkness to light, from imprisonment to freedom.

    <b>Abstract:</b>  
    Based on the theory developed from research conducted by Leiter and Maslach and Marzano and Heflebower in Jacobson (2016), a teacher's self-welfare can be a factor that causes burnout in teachers with indicators having isolated feelings, lack of support from coworkers and administrators, class management problems, and how much the possibility of career improvement will be obtained. This study aims to determine the relationship between burnout and subjective well-being of teachers in Yogyakarta. The number of subjects in this study were 119 teachers in Yogyakarta. Data collection methods are carried out using work Maslach Inventory Burnout scale and Teacher Subjective Wellbeing scale. The results of this study indicate a significant negative relationship between burnout and teacher subjective well-being with r = -.416 and p = 0.000 (p <0.05), so the hypothesis is accepted. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the higher a person's work fatigue, the lower their subjective well-being will be.

    <b>Abstract:</b>  
    This study was aimed to determine the relationship between Social Support and Problem Solving among teachers in Yogyakarta. The subjects of the study were 106 teachers in Yogyakarta, which consist of teachers in public schools, private schools and inclusive schools. The scale used Personal Problem-Solving Inventory and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Statistical results used the Spearman Rho technique showed that there was a significant positive relationship between problem solving and social support (p = 0,000, r = 0,401). The relationship between the two variables showed that the higher the Social Support shown by teachers in Yogyakarta Indonesia, the higher the Problem Solving of their life.

    <b>Abstract:</b>  
    Teacher's subjective well-being has a big impact on the aspects of life and also the teaching process conducted in school. Hence, in the term of fulfilling these things and to get subjective well-being, a stance is needed as the consequence to always feel grateful for any situations which happened. This study aims to determine the relationship between the gratitude and subjective well-being of teachers in Yogyakarta. The number of respondents in this study was 119 teachers in Yogyakarta. The research sampling technique was convenience sampling. This study uses quantitative methods. The data collection methods were carried out using a questionnaire consisting of 2 scales, namely the Gratitude Questionnaire scale 6 (GQ6) and the Teacher Subjective Well-being Scale (TSWQ). The results of this study indicate that there was a positive correlation between gratitude and the teacher's well-being with a coefficient of 0.340 and p = 0.000 (p <0.05), the hypothesis is accepted.  Based on these results, the conclusion is the subjective well-being can be determined by the teacher's level of gratitude. Teacher’s Subjective well-being can be seen through the intensity and frequency of the teacher’s gratitude.

    <b>Abstract:</b>  
    Earthquake is caused by tectonic activity deep inside the crust resulting in shaking of ground and large-scale devastation from fault-rupture in any direction away from the epicenter and soil stratification. Seismic hazards result in slope instability, ground collapse or subsidence, liquefaction of soil base, structural destruction, tsunami etc. in the near or far-fields along line of propagation of faults. Seismic vulnerability analysis defines the damage prognosis in the light of potentiality of an earthquake in seismically active locations. While an earthquake at any region cannot be avoided being a natural phenomenon, the anthropogenic environmental impacts can advance the clock and increase the possibility of far major devastations from the quake. This present study, based on secondary data, tries to find the potential vulnerabilities of unrestricted groundwater extraction and enhancement of impulses in the identified fault-lines traversing from the Northeast of India to the Bengal Basin or the vice versa.
   <br> Geographical convergence of Indian and Eurasian plates developed the sub-Himalayan mountainous topography, which is very young and still in the process of consolidation.  Model studies of earthquakes at this collision-plate boundary identify, this convergence is accommodated on the Main Himalayan Thrust Front. Bureau of Indian Standards marked the Indian landmass into three tectonic provinces, viz. Himalayan region, Indo-Gangetic basin and Peninsular India and shown high seismic hazard in most parts of the Northeast and the Bengal Basin.. Four seismic zones are designated as II, III, IV and V. While the region close to the Bay of Bengal is placed under Zone III, most parts of the northeast of Indian region is  placed  in  zone V, at the  highest  level  of  seismic  potential in  Seismic Zonation Map of  India. The last major quake of April, 2015 at Gorkha near Kathmandu (Nepal) did not generate high-frequency waves and unzipped only a small part of locked energy from lower edge of the Main Himalayan Thrust Front. The Western Nepal and areas under north and northeast of India – extending up to Bengal Basin thus remained under potentially increased risk of any major quakes in future. Alternatively, the quakes extending from Sumatran Subduction Trench along Lesser Sunda Islands also have the potential to extend seismic impulse through Eocene Hinge Zone from Bengal Basin to the Northeast of India. The seismic vulnerabilities for this geographical region can be thus anticipated from any of these two directions. Geological and geophysical studies indicate seismic activity in these divergent margins with NE-SW orientation. Study of seismicity and fault planes of past earthquakes in Bengal Basin also focuses on deformations of the northern Indian plate.  
  <br>  The Gangetic delta region is formed by sedimentary alluvial deposits of Brahmaputra–Ganga–Barak river systems. Soil deposits are soft, erratic and geomorphologically divided into fluvial plain, tidal flat, natural levee and fed by numerous channels. The soil stratum covers alternate layers of clay, silt and sand horizons not fully consolidated. Studies of last earthquake of Gorkha (Nepal, 2015) showed major contribution of groundwater extraction for advancement of the devastations. Enormous extraction of ground water, far exceeding the recharge potential, creates formation of void space below overburden soil-stratum in the entire Northeast and the Bengal Basin. Confined groundwater is increasingly under pressure due to weight of the overburden and also further pressed by piling of deep columns for high-rise concrete structures for developmental activities. The overburden pressure is increasing below that region. Due to over-extraction, water-level of underlying aquifers vis-à-vis pore–water pressure is depressing year after year. This anthropogenic environmental impact of groundwater depletion is likely to advance the potential for seismic impulse and enhance scale of devastations of an earthquake episode, act as catalysts for large-scale soil liquefaction and structural dislocations.
