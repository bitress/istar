                  <b>Abstract:</b>  
                   The present Education through the curricular or Institutional training identified the importance of introducing the functioning of official training programmes like NSS and NCC for students to improve their moral stature, leadership qualities and organizational capabilities with selfless motives.  While serving the society as a volunteer or as a public servant or as an organization the students need to realize that “Discipline” is the key success in any field of their life.  Thus, the Educational institutions with the introduction of NSS and NCC activities rightly trying to improve the standards of the students in respect of the discipline, leadership and volunteering capabilities.
                    Unless the present youth realizes that a part of their life should be service to the humanity then only the total structure of the society will become progressive and peaceful.  To reach such a tranquil state of mind, students should be trained systematically and simultaneously with academics. Community participation and community services provide our educational institutions with an effective means to become committed communities and to achieve the academic aims and plans.  Thus opening a door for our young people to enter and grow in leadership, which is transformational.
                    The aim of NCC is to train young boys and girls to be better citizens and future leaders in all walks of life. The participation in NCC programmes the students will be benefited by developing the qualities of character, courage, discipline, leadership, and secular outlook, spirit of adventure and sportsmanship and selfless services to become useful citizens.  NCC also plays a unique role in the community development.  The NCC participants actively involved in some of the activities namely a) Adult Education   b) Environment c) Social services and d) Health etc.
                    Participation in NSS programmes gives a broader scope for the students to involve in various activities. For example: - a) Environment Enrichment and Conservation, b) Health, Family welfare and Nutrition programme, c) Awareness for improvement of the status of women d) Social Service programmes, e) Production oriented programme, f) Programmes for working during emergencies, g) Education and Recreation etc.
                    Active participation of students in the above mentioned NSS programmes helps in developing qualities like character, courage, resourcefulness, confidence, decision making, democratic attitude, leadership skills etc.

                      Students often have difficulties working on their college assignments on time. The number of assignments and activities outside the lecture make students have to divided their time well. However, many students also chose to postponed their duties until the deadline runs out, as known as procrastination. On the other hand, students who have good self-regulation can manage their tasks optimally and on time. This study was aimed to examined the relationship between self-regulated learning with academic procrastination. Respondents in this study were psychology students of Universitas Islam Indonesia class of 2015, 2016 and 2017, with 64 students consisting of 32 women and 32 men. Data retrieval method in this study used a scale Self-Regulation of Learning Self Report Scale (SRL-SRS) and Shortened Version of The Procrastination Scale. The results of the analysis showing correlation of t = -.276. This shows that there is a significant negative relationship between self-regulated learning with academic procrastination in psychology students of Universitas Islam Indonesia. This means that the higher student’s self-regulated learning, the lower is the academic procrastination.

              The purpose of this paper is to investigate the aspects of basic word orders and their variations in English and Korean, and the interactions with the iconicity of distance principle for the basic word orders and their variations. The basic word orders are discussed in terms of word orders within the major constituents such as verb-object constructions and multiple adverbial constructions. The followings are argued in this paper. The first claim is that there are basic word orders in Korean as well as in English and the canonical symmetric arrangement between the (basic) word orders in English and Korean. The second claim is that basic word orders and their variations can be equally accounted for in terms of distance principle of iconicity, even though the principle applies more strongly for English.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          The word gender describes the socially-constructed roles and responsibilities that societies think about acceptable for men and women. Gender equality implies that men and women have equal power, equal rights and equal opportunities for monetary independence, education, and personal development. Gender discrimination can be seen at all ages and stages of development over the Globe. Women's management may be a crucial facet of achieving gender equality. It includes increasing a woman's sense of self dignity, self-worth, decision-making power, access to opportunities and resources, power and management over her own life within and outside the house, and her ability to result in the amendment. Nonetheless, gender problems aren't centered on girls alone, however on the connection between men and women in society. The actions and attitudes of men and boys play a vital role in achieving gender equality. Gender equality may be a right, however, our world faces a persistent gap in access to opportunities and decision-making power for women and men. Women have fewer opportunities for economic participation, less access to basic and better education, larger health and safety risks, and fewer political participation than men globally. Guaranteeing the rights of women and giving them opportunities to achieve their full potential is crucial not just for attaining gender equality however conjointly for meeting a good social order and prosperity. Women contribute to the health and productivity of their families, communities, and countries, making a ripple result that advantages everybody.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          In this global society with the 21st century education system, there is a critical need for students to be more knowledgeable and skilful in art field. But, in order to fit the learning needs of our students, it is crucial to examine the way we teach the subject. The pedagogy of art of the 21st century has been changed significantly, highlights that art teachers should know how to adapt the pedagogy effectively. Today, the teaching of art education needs to be highly-effective where teachers should be able to integrate the use of technology in learning, able to increase students’ participation and involvement in meaningful and challenging learning environments. The teaching also needs to combine technology with artistic skills such as the 4C’s of Creativity, Critical thinking, Communication and Collaboration. In our context, the new National Education System, “Sistem Pendidikan Negara 21 (SPN 21) prepares students’ learning to be more innovative, balanced, well-rounded, able to apply technology for learning, strong in communication and collaborative skills, able to think creatively, critically, analytically and practically. Understanding the 21st century teaching and learning of primary art education provides a new insight into the quality of student learning development and achievement. Therefore, a study was conducted to examine the 21st century teaching and learning of primary art education to improve the teacher education in Brunei. The study employed a qualitative approach in data collection and analysis. It involved classroom observations and interviews with 10 qualified primary art teachers. The findings show that the teachers enabled to integrate the use of technology and in this way, students are motivated to learn art actively. However, the study highlights the needs for development and improvement in teaching and learning the artistic skills of the 4C’s.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          Mistress, a novel by Anita Nair, deals with the subjugation of women by patriarchal hegemony. In this novel the author depicts women from across the different rungs of society grappling to find meaningful existence. They willingly enter into relationships that are taboo and detrimental to their well being. This paper examines how Nair's novel portrays the defiance of women who are not afraid to fight for their rights. The results of these acts of defiance are unimaginably punishing, yet these women act as would their western counterparts. Normally such acts of violation of societal norms could prove lethal to the Indian woman. These middle-class Indian women boldly follow their dreams and fulfil their heart's desires with a vengeance aiming at proving their worth in a man-made world. The paper attempts to study women in contrasting roles as contenders for traditionality and on the contrary as breakers of societal norms held sacrosanct.

          It is no secret that women too can contribute to the development of society. The role of women in development and society has always been undermined by male chauvinists. Gender equality is one of the issues that has always caused struggle between the two sexes. Gender, class, race and ethnicity are the issues the modern woman continues to navigate away. Women are struggling to move away from these issues, and contribute positively to sectors such as education, health, business and to the same as men, women can be useful in teaching and also acquire knowledge to apply it positively in society. To educate girls is to reduce poverty.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          The United Nations General Assembly has taken a resolution for Sustainable Development Goal for the year 2030. This resolution itself is a danger bell, that the Humanity is in Crisis. “The hour of crisis is the hour of self examination, and the right self examination lies nearer to the decisions taken in the past”.  If we grope into the recent past of humanity we find the roots of the present crisis in the process of Modernization or Westernization. The Empire of Industrialization has built on the foundations of Science and technology which is basically empirical, logical and analytical in nature and the basic philosophy behind industrialization is utilitarianism which promises maximum good to the maximum number of people. Today we see that western Imperialism and colonization has influenced almost all the people of the world and the success of western civilization in terms of material affluence has forced everybody to believe that Science and Technology is the only way out for the development. Hence in the present educational Scenario Science and technology enjoys a high profile and the Humanities and Social Sciences vice versa.
          While the whole world is running behind Science and Technology, an American - expert on thinking Edward De’ Bono says – “The last millennium has not been a success. We have made huge advances in Science and Technology but have still been let down by excellent and limited ways of thinking”. In his book “New thinking for new millennium “Admitting the drawbacks of Western educational system he says “ Education is obsessed with Literacy and Numeracy, yet operacy (skills of doing) is almost entirely neglected. “ The alarming rate of increase in the number of suicides and homicides in the affluent countries have prompted the American Psychologists for further research on human mind I.e. , the software of brain. The findings of research provides a firm base to defend the Social Sciences and humanities in the field of education. Even in Andhra Pradesh the ignorance on the part of parents and also teachers who misguide their students is creating havoc in the lives of our youth who are the future of our country and future oh humanity.
          In the field of education it is a traditional practice that students with higher I.Q. levels are considered highly intelligent and they opt for Science subjects and students with lower I.Q. are considered to be less intelligent and they opt for Social Sciences and Humanities. “ All these years we were believing that intelligence has to do with thinking, analyzing, remembering, comparing , applying, appearing for exams, obtaining high marks etc. These qualities, it is  argued lead to top position, lucrative pay packages palatial houses, imported cars, security, success holidays etc. Consequently people work hard to develop their I.Q. and ignore their emotions. How far it is correct to nurture our I.Q. ignoring E.Q. or nourishing the rational mind and ignoring the   emotional mind or nourishing sciences and technology ignoring Humanities and social Sciences. Now the question arises whether human beings have two minds? Research done in the field of Neurobiology gives a positive answer to this question.
          In 1980s two American Psychologists, Peter Salovey of Yale University and John Mayor of University of New Hampshire coined a phrase called Emotional intelligence. Science reporter of New York Times adopted it and introduced it in his best seller “Emotional intelligence why it matters more than I.Q. “. According to Goleman I.Q. accounts for only about 20% person’s success in life and the balance can be attributed to emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is also called as E.Q. the Emotional Quotient. In a lay persons language this could be defined as what feels good and how to get from bad to good. A more formal academic definition refers to Emotional awareness and emotional management skills which enables you to balance emotion and reason so as to maximize one’s own long term happiness. Emotional intelligence is ability to balance between head and heart or thinking and feeling parts of the mind.
          Basing on the research done in the field of Neurobiology individual person should nourish one’s own mind with Science and Technology on one hand, Humanities and Social Sciences are the other. Man’s greed has already disturb the balance of Nature and now it is on the verge of creating imbalance in Human mind by forcing the children to study Science and Technology, irrespective of the capabilities of an individual child. Unilateral development of Science and Technology ignoring Social Sciences and humanities made the human society unsustainable. Increased conflict,mental sickness, crime, suicides and genocides shaking the foundation of human existence. Since emotional intelligence is moving from bad situation to good schooling of E.Q. is the solution for this human tragedy. Enriching or balancing our syllabi with Social sciences and Humanities will help to create balanced individuals with a rational mind and a feeling heart.
          Globalization is an outcome of utilitarian thinking. Even in this age of Globalization the experts in organizational behavior opine that the work force with technological skills need to have peoples skills. Along with technological knowledge the managers need to have the knowledge of Social sciences and Humanities. Understanding other person’s culture, social background and emotions, aids a person to empathize with peers and subordinates. Today distances and national boarders are disappearing rapidly and management is no longer confined to the National borders. Along with Science and Technology if a person has social skills he will be successful in his work place. Here social consciousness and emotional awareness play an important role and these can be inculcated through social sciences and humanities.
          The people and races with ethnocentric views suffer from parochialism and parochialism is detrimental to human society. Hence creating individuals with empathy and emotional intelligence is need of the hour for a sustainable human society. Social sciences and Humanities is the remedy for the present social malady.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          Empowerment can be defined in many ways, however, when talking about women's empowerment, empowerment means accepting and allowing women who are on the outside of the decision-making process. women are empowered when they are able to access the opportunities available to them without limitations and restrictions such as in education, profession and lifestyle. Feeling entitled to make your own decisions creates a sense of empowerment. Content: To attain this one has to realize their power and also the identity, because its she how underestimate her own determination and ability, so its important to realize the girl power, only then one could achieve and inspire others to be strong.
          I do not wish women to have power over men, but on themselves.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          This paper attempts to explore the process in which Sani Yi women embroidery traders in Shilin, Yunnan Province, China, empower themselves through economic activities engagement. In the past, Sani Yi men were viewed as active subjects in economic undertaking. In contrast, Sani Yi women were traditionally restricted in domestic life and agricultural responsibilities. The conventional constraints on women have resulted in women’s subordinate status. With growing social change, an increasing number of women presently enter into the market to participate in economic activities. The research shows that in many cases Sani Yi women are compelled to participate in different types of economic activities when their husbands are unable to provide enough economic support for their families. Meanwhile, the fact that economic participation entails change in the women’s lives and in relations with men cannot be ignored. The engagement between Lessinger’s idea of ‘sacrificial motherhood’ and Kabeer’s perspective on ‘women’s empowerment’ draws attention to the key root and the result of women’s economic undertaking. This paper is based on personal narrative approach to explore three Sani women’s experiences and life trajectories. Its objective is to examine the motivation of Sani Yi women’s economic participation. It also draws attention to how each woman’s economic engagement allows her to transform the household gendered division of labor, acquire decision-making power, break the limitations on women’s spatial movement, change women’s attitude towards domestic violence, and gain social status. The study leads to the conclusion that the conventional limitations on Sani Yi women are destabilized gradually even it still continues to exist, and gender relations between Sani Yi women and men are not fixed and rigid but flexible and dynamic.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          The chaos of Partition with its climate of political turmoil and disorder has proved fertile ground for authors setting works, with themes of abduction and rape, within it. Bapsi Sidhwa’s The IceCandy Man and Khushwant Singh’s Train to Pakistan come most forcibly to mind. These books, which depict the cruelty and barbarism of human beings, draw much of their force by focusing on the destructive effects of mass passions. Even Keki N. Daruwalla’s splendid Love across the Salt Desert draws much of its force from the fact that the elopement happens across a political border in times of social unrest. A Flight of Pigeons is another such book set during the mob violence of the Sepoy Mutiny. Such themes have been popular with writers simply because they allow them to put forth the human condition in all its naked truth. This paper seeks to examine the violence perpetrated on women and the treatment of their bodies as sites of contest through a critical study of two novellas dealing with abduction set during times of mob violence - Amrita Pritam’s Pinjar (The Skeleton) and Ruskin Bond’s A Flight of Pigeons. The similarity of form (both are actually somewhat long short stories) and the similarity of content (abduction during mass unrest) belie the difference in the treatment of the subjectmatter by both these literary luminaries. The aim of the paper is thus threefold. First, to critique the novellas in terms of their similarity and assert how they deal with the body as a site of encroachment. The second, is to compare their difference in treatment and to analyze how Bond and Pritam approach the content through drastically different perspectives, and lastly to reflect on the role of gender politics to which this difference in treatment is ascribed.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          Business acumen delivers a rich set of benefits that drive significant and tangible return on investment. It removes the complexity of converting raw data into meaningful business  intelligence  by  giving  organizations  the  power  to  transform  data  from  multiple  sources  into  accurate,  consumable  information  that  can  be  shared  securely  throughout  the  enterprise.  It  enables  users  to  make  informed  business  decisions  quickly  and  confidently  by  providing  the  query  and  reporting  tools  they  need  to  find,  share,  manage,  publish  and  analyze  information.  The  goal  of  business acumen  is  to  enable  management  to  make  more  intelligent  decisions  on  the  basis  of  knowledge  extracted  from  data.  Thus,  data  gives  information,   information  gives  knowledge  and  knowledge  gives  an  idea  to  do  things  in quicker  and   more  productive  manner. Business  acumen  is  a  complex  competency  that  far  too  many  organizations  leave  to  chance.  In  fact many organizations simply hope to hire outside talent to boost their internal core of industry  and  market  knowledge.  As  the  job  market  tightens  and  the  competition  for  talent  increases  ,  this  option  looks  less  strategic  and  more  like  a  research  to  issues. Organizations  need  a  strategic  effort  to  boost  the  level  of  business  acumen  among  employees,  increasing  knowledge,  financial  acumen  and  market  awareness  cannot  happen  in  a  void  or  a  vacuum. Organizations must be actively engaged in this effort by fostering a culture where continuous  improvement  is  the  norm  and  learning  is  an  everyday  part  of  culture

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
          This study focuses on the extraction of cellulose nano whiskers (CNWs) from the leaves of Adansonia kilima (AK), usually known as African Baobab, using a combination of a microwave-assisted alkali (KOH) pre-treatment with subsequent bleaching process prior to ultra-sonication. Ultra-sonication was carried out using ionic liquid (ILs) of1butyl 3 methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (Bmim-HSO4). Process parameters for ultra-sonication were optimized using 2-Level Factorial Box Behnken Design (BBD).Process variables such as ultra-sonication power (x1), hydrolysing time (x2) and temperature (x3) were varied. Responses selected were percentage crystallinity index, CrI % (y 1) and yield % (y 1) for the finally procured CNWs sample. Regression analysis was carried out to develop quadratic model to analyse the effect of process variables on ILs assisted ultra-sonication process. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that ultra-sonication power was the most influential aspect for hydrolysing the amorphous segments of crude cellulose extracted from baobab leaves.  A relative study of the physio-chemical properties of the starting lignocellulosic substrate (AK), KOH pre-treated, bleached and ILs assisted ultra-sonicated CNWs was conducted. The synthesized samples were characterize using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, Atomic force microscopy, High resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Thermo-gravimetric and Zeta Potential analysis. Under optimum condition, the extracted CNWs showed an average width of 15–20 nm; with high crystallinity index of 86.46 %.  This research provides an insight about the delignification of Adansonia kilima (AK) leaves and its’ effective conversion to CNWs having high crystallinity.

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
        Cyber-security also called as information technology security or e-information security is the act of protecting electronic devices, networks and data from malicious digital attackers. Cyber-security counters various threats such as cyber-attack. An intentional attempt by a person or an organisation to break other’s information system to get some kind of benefit from the network of the victim is referred as cyber-attack. Cyber-security threats have been on the rise with the advancement of technology in recent years. The cyber-security threats affect almost every industry or organisation irrespective of its scale. This is applicable to a wide range of contexts including business and mobile communication systems. Hence research and investigation is required to improve the cyber-security systems to make it highly robust and secure.  Machine Learning (ML) has appeared as one of the most popular areas of research by the academics and industry in recent times due to its applicability in wide range of interdisciplinary research domain. The ability of the computers to learn without being explicitly programmed and to make the best use of a performance criterion based on example data or past experience is referred as Machine Learning (ML). In ML, inference is made from a sample based on evidence and reasoning. ML techniques can build models of system behaviours and make future predictions using those models based on new input data. ML can respond to cyber-security attacks in real time by analysing the threat in a better way and will be able to prevent threats and active attacks. It can make cyber-security systems simpler, less expensive, more proactive and more effective in preventing similar attacks as well as responding to change of behaviour. In this keynote/plenary talk, fundamentals of Cyber-security systems as well as various security threats and vulnerabilities encountered in it will be discussed.  Suitable ML techniques that can be applied to improve the existing cyber-security systems along with research challenges in cyber-security domain will also be discussed

          <b>Abstract:</b>  
        Indian colleges grant nearly a million engineering degrees annually, flooding the job market with a huge supply of engineers, with skills that have very little demand. Now the country has an excess supply of engineers who are unemployed with many of them unemployable. However, there still lies a huge scope for well trained and skilled engineers.  With growth of world population exceeding 9 billion, basic needs such as energy, food and water, housing, transportation and health will become more acute. The demand for sustainable development will require redefined and innovative engineering talent and leadership. The stage is set for a Renaissance period for engineering education. A recent report by MIT titled “The Global State of the Art in Engineering Education” states that the future leaders in engineering education will focus on “work-based learning, multidisciplinary programs and a dual emphasis on engineering design and self-reflection.” After centuries of global advancements, India is at crossroads. It is clear that since Independence, India has produced a large number of competent, qualified engineers who have contributed and made an impact in the corporate world internationally. Despite these positive outcomes, a critical analysis of the recent trends is required. The engineering curriculum of the 20th century is no longer sufficient to address the engineering challenges of the 21st century. Increasing complexity and interdisciplinarity of the engineering profession requires equipping engineering graduates with creativity and innovative mind to facilitate the development of novel and effective technological solutions to problems stimulated by change. There is however a disconnect appears among creativity, innovation and engineering. There has been growing research evidence that followed methods in teaching and learning of engineering are becoming obsolete and do not meet the requirements of future engineering graduates. Educational programs focus excessively on narrow and deep technical specifications, with little or no room in the curriculum for developing the ability to think and act creatively. Unless this disconnect is addressed through holistic changes to engineering education, we risk producing unemployable engineers who will be obsolete immediately after passing out with respect to the rapid change in society.
